# SQL Mini Project

## ðŸ“– Overview

This project contains a collection of SQL queries designed to practice different levels of SQL concepts. The queries cover basics, filtering, aggregation, multi-table joins, subqueries, and set operations. The project is based on a simulated e-commerce database with tables such as **customers**, **orders**, **products**, **order\_items**, and **payments**.
